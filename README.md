# Challenge 14: Bike Sharing

## Overview of Bike Sharing
In this project, Tableau is used to create worksheets, dashboards and a story on New York bike-sharing data from August 2019. The purpose of the analysis is to present to investors who are considering a bike-sharing program in Des Moines with the intent to impress that it is a sound investment.
## Bike Sharing Results

The data provided by the City of New York required some refinements and represents only August 2019. The presentaion has been prepared as a [Tableau story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/hala6514#!/vizhome/Challenge14_16173215654330/Bike-SharingStory?publish=yes), and the following narrative would accompany the story:
### Typical Ride Durations
These charts show that the vast majority of rides are under 30 minutes, indicating that the bike sharing in New York is used primarily for short distances and durations. This also indicates that bikes are generally returned to the stations promptly. In addition, males used the bikes approximately 4:1 compared to females.

### Time of Rides Heat Maps
The rides are concentrated during the morning and evening commute times on weekdays with the heaviest days being Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. On weekends, the usage spread more evenly throughout the day, more heavily in the middle of the day. The subscribers use the bike-sharing program significantly more than the customer. This also emphasizes that men use this service more than women.

### Start Location User Type Distribution
This map illustrates that the pick-up locations for bike usage are very evenly distributed across the city. It also reveals that the number of bikes taken from each station is roughly the same. This could indicate that the pick-up stations are conveniently located for the subscribers and customers.

### Time of Day Usage
This bar chart shows that the peak hours for pick-up is around 8am and 9am in addition to 5pm and 6pm. This corroborates the indication that bikes are used more heavily during the commute hours on weekdays. This also indicates that the optimal hours for maintenance or re-distribution of bikes are 1am to 6am.

### Daily Busiest Hours by User Type and Gender
For people who identify their gender the majority are subscribers, and for Unknown gender they are mostly customers.

### Pick Up and Drop Off Distribution
These maps highlight the most popular pick-up and drop-off locations and indicate that the bikes do not require heavy re-distribution at night to ensure that they are at the station where people would be wanting them.

## Bike Sharing Summary

If New York City bike-sharing program is representative of what other cities could experience with their bike-sharing programs, then there is a strong case to be made for Des Moines to implement one. However, it is important to note that this data does not indicate to which level New York City is a cyclist friendly city, for example, bike lanes and separate signals. New York City is a densely populated city making it less commuter friendly by car, therefore, Des Moines will want to consider analysing their work commuting patterns to determine if they will see similar usage during work hours. 

The two additional visualizations prepared are included in the story under sections "Start Location User Type Distribution" and "Daily Busiest Hours by User Type and Gender".
